Informations:-
👉🏻 When we create a Book actually on frontend will really stored somewhere, was stored on our backend server and when we reload the React app, we're fethching this data from that server and since the server runs on its own domain but technically of course on the same machine as our frontned, that request is super fast.
👉🏻 In frontend we used functional component to build components. Although we can use class components as well.
