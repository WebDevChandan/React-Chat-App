Note:-
1. sObject in Salesforce is nothing but a Table that stored in Salesforce platform Database.
2. Custom object named with '__c'. Example: Invoice__c, payroll__c
3. Account a :- Account is a sObject and 'a' is the variable that we declare for it. This is the declaration of an object. So, here, 'a' is an account sObject variable.
4. Performing BULK DML operations is the recommended way because it helps avoid hitting governor limits.
